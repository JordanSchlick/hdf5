# HDF5
This repository contains a slightly modified version of libhdf5 and HighFive that compile under Unreal and other build systems.

libhdf5 version: 1.14.1-2  
HighFive version: 2.7.1

The requirement to build under cmake has been removed and it can be compiled by anything by including all c files.

This repository can be cloned into the `OpenStorm/Radar/Deps` folder to enable support for h5/odim radar files.
